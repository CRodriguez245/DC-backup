# Finding Who Registered decisioncoach.io

## 🤔 You Didn't Register the Domain

**We need to find out who manages the domain registration so we can update nameservers.**

---

## 🔍 Option 1: Check WHOIS Information

**We can check WHOIS to see:**
- Who the registrar is
- Who owns the domain
- Where nameservers are managed

**Let's check this first!**

---

## 🔍 Option 2: Check Vercel Dashboard

**Since the domain is in Vercel, check:**

1. **Vercel Dashboard → Domains → decisioncoach.io**
2. **Look for:**
   - Domain registration information
   - "Registrar" field
   - "Nameservers" section
   - Any indication of who registered it

**If Vercel is the registrar:**
- Nameservers might be managed in Vercel
- We can update them there

## 🔍 Option 3: Check Team/Organization

**Is this a team/organization domain?**

- **Who else has access to the project?**
- **Check Vercel team members**
- **Who set up the domain initially?**
- **Ask team members who registered it**

---

## 🔍 Option 4: Check Billing/Email

**Who receives:**
- Domain registration receipts?
- Domain renewal emails?
- Domain-related billing?

**This will tell us who the registrar is.**

## 🎯 Quick Check: WHOIS

**Let's check WHOIS first to find the registrar:**

The `whois` command will show us:
- Registrar name
- Current nameservers
- Domain owner information

**Once we know the registrar, we can guide you to update nameservers there.**

## 📋 What Information Do You Have?

**Tell me:**
1. **Do you have access to domain billing/emails?**
2. **Is it a team/organization domain?**
3. **Can you check Vercel for registration info?**
4. **Who else might know who registered it?**

**Or we can check WHOIS to find out automatically!**
