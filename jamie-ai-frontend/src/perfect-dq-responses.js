Let's start by clearly defining what you're facing - you're feeling burnt out from coding and drawn to more people-oriented, strategic work. What specifically about coding is draining you? Is it the isolation, technical complexity, lack of user impact, or something else? And when you say you want more people interaction and strategy, what does that look like to you - leading teams, influencing product direction, or something different? Let's also explore what you actually know about product management - have you researched what PMs do day-to-day, talked to any PMs about their experiences, or considered how your engineering background might be an advantage?",

What about technical product management, where you'd leverage your coding background while focusing on strategy? Or engineering management, where you'd lead technical teams? Solutions architecture, which combines technical expertise with client interaction? Or even transitioning to a more people-facing engineering role like developer advocacy or technical consulting? Have you researched the day-to-day reality of these roles - what percentage of time is spent in meetings vs. hands-on work vs. strategic planning? What are the career progression paths, compensation differences, and work-life balance considerations? Which of these options align with your values around technical challenge, people interaction, strategic thinking, and career growth?",

Then let's systematically score each career option against these criteria. But let's also challenge some assumptions - you mentioned being burnt out from coding, but have you considered if it's coding itself or the specific projects, company culture, team dynamics, or lack of user impact? What if you could address these root causes while staying in engineering? Finally, let's create a concrete testing plan: commit to exploring one path for the next month through shadowing, informational interviews, side projects, or taking on relevant responsibilities. Which option feels most worth testing first, and what specific actions will you take to gather real data about that path?",

Let's first clarify the decision - are you considering product management specifically, or exploring any role that combines your technical background with people and strategy? What's driving this change - is it the isolation of coding, lack of user impact, technical complexity, or something else? And what does 'people interaction and strategy' mean to you - leading teams, influencing product direction, collaborating with stakeholders, or something different?
