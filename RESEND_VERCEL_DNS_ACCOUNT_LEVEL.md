# Finding DNS Records in Vercel - Account Level

## ⚠️ Important: DNS Records Are at Account/Team Level, Not Project Level

**The sidebar you're seeing is PROJECT settings. DNS records are managed at the TEAM/ACCOUNT level.**

## 📍 How to Access DNS Records in Vercel

### Step 1: Go to Team/Account Settings (Not Project Settings)

**You're currently in PROJECT settings. We need TEAM/ACCOUNT settings.**

1. **Look at the TOP of the page** (above the sidebar)
2. **Find your team/account name** (usually in top left or top navigation)
3. **Click on it** or look for a dropdown/selector
4. **Click "Settings"** or "Team Settings" (NOT project settings)

**OR:**

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click your team/account name** (top left or top navigation)
3. **Click "Settings"** from the dropdown
4. **Click "Domains"** in the left sidebar
5. **Find your domain** (`decisioncoach.io`)
6. **Click on it**
7. **Look for "DNS" tab or "DNS Records" section**

### Step 2: Alternative Path - Direct Domain Management

**Try this direct path:**

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/[your-team-name]/settings/domains
   (Replace `[your-team-name]` with your actual team name)

2. **OR:**
   - Click your profile/team icon (top right)
   - Look for "Team Settings" or "Account Settings"
   - Click "Domains"
   - Find `decisioncoach.io`
   - Click on it
   - Look for DNS section

---

## 🔍 What You're Looking For

**In Team/Account Settings → Domains → [Your Domain]:**

You should see:
- **Tabs:** Overview, Configuration, **DNS** ← Click this!
- **OR a "DNS Records" section** with existing records
- **An "Add Record" or "+" button**

---

## ❓ If You Still Can't Find It

**Vercel might manage DNS differently. Let's check:**

**Option 1: Check if Vercel uses external DNS**

1. **Go back to the domain configuration page** you saw earlier
2. **Look for any mention of "DNS" or "Nameservers"**
3. **Check if it says "Managed by Vercel" or something else**

**Option 2: DNS might be in a different location**

Some Vercel setups have DNS in:
- Team/Account → Domains → [Domain] → DNS tab
- Or DNS might need to be managed externally if using custom nameservers

---

## 🎯 Quick Check

**To confirm where DNS is managed:**

1. **Go to the domain configuration page** (the one you showed me earlier)
2. **Look for ANY mention of:**
   - "DNS"
   - "Nameservers"
   - "DNS Records"
   - "DNS Management"

**Or tell me:**
- What team/account name are you using in Vercel?
- Is `decisioncoach.io` the main domain, or is it a subdomain?

This will help me give you the exact path!
