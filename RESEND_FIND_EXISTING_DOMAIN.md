# Finding Your Existing Domain in Vercel

## 🎯 You're on the Domains Page

**What you're seeing:**
- "Add a domain" card with "Buy Domain" and "Add Existing Domain" buttons

**But you ALREADY have a domain!** (`decisioncoach.io`)

---

## 🔍 Where Is Your Existing Domain?

### Option 1: Check if There's a Domains List Above or Below

**On the page you're seeing:**

1. **Scroll UP** - Is there a list of domains at the top?
2. **Scroll DOWN** - Is there a list below the "Add a domain" card?
3. **Look for any tabs** - Like "All Domains", "Active Domains", etc.

**If you see `decisioncoach.io` in a list, click on it!**

---

### Option 2: Domain Might Be at Project Level

**Since you accessed it earlier through project settings:**

1. **Go back to the project** (the one you were in earlier)
2. **Settings → Domains** (the path you used before)
3. **Click on `decisioncoach.io`** (the domain configuration page you showed me)
4. **On that page, look for:**
   - Tabs at the top (Overview, Configuration, DNS, etc.)
   - Scroll down to find "DNS Records" section
   - Any mention of "DNS" or "DNS Management"

---

### Option 3: Check Different Domain Management Location

**The domain might be managed differently:**

1. **From the "Add Existing Domain" area you're seeing**
2. **Is there a search bar** to find existing domains?
3. **Or a filter/tab** to show "My Domains" vs "Add Domain"?

---

## 🎯 Quick Action: Go Back to Where You Found It Before

**You showed me the domain configuration page earlier with:**
- Domain: `decisioncoach.io`
- Environment connection settings
- Save/Cancel buttons

**Let's go back there and check more carefully:**

1. **Go to your project** (where you accessed Settings → Domains before)
2. **Settings → Domains**
3. **Click on `decisioncoach.io`**
4. **On that page:**
   - **Look at the TOP** - Are there tabs? (Overview, Configuration, DNS, etc.)
   - **Scroll DOWN** - Is there a "DNS Records" section below?
   - **Look for ANY mention of "DNS"** anywhere on the page

---

## ❓ Question

**On the page you're currently seeing (the "Add a domain" page):**

- **Is there ANY list of domains** (even if empty)?
- **Or is it ONLY the "Add a domain" card?**

**If there's NO list showing your existing domain, let's go back to the project settings where you found it before!**

---

## ✅ Alternative: Check if DNS is Managed Elsewhere

**Since your nameservers are `ns1.vercel-dns.com`, DNS SHOULD be in Vercel.**

**But let's double-check:**

- **Go back to the domain configuration page** (Settings → Domains → decisioncoach.io)
- **Look for ANY link, button, or section** that mentions "DNS", "DNS Records", or "Manage DNS"

**Even if it's not obvious, it might be there!**
